## SparkSQL
Spark SQL is a module in Apache Spark that provides a programming interface for working with structured and semi-structured data using SQL queries. It allows you to query data in Spark using SQL syntax and also provides a DataFrame API for working with structured data in a more programmatic way.
In this code, **ss.sql** is used to execute a SQL query on the DataFrame, which is a structured data source in Spark. The SQL query is selecting all columns from the DataFrame, and then the show() method is used to display the results of the query in a tabular format.
